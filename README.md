# GameSelect
Demo: [repos.coltonw.ca/GameSelect](https://repos.coltonw.ca/GameSelect)

## Description
For this project, I created a sales funnel that recommends three video games to a user based on their preferences. I used JavaScript, JSON, and AJAX for this project. The Bootstrap framework was used for styling. I utilized the RAWG API to collect information for games such as the cover image, release date, Metacritic score, and ESRB rating.
