## Description
This was my final project for a web scripting course I took in 2021. I created a sales funnel that recommends three video games to a user based on their preferences. I used JavaScript, JSON, and AJAX for this project. The Bootstrap framework was used for styling. I utilized the RAWG API to collect information for games such as the cover image, release date, Metacritic score, and ESRB rating.
